New features in CC: Tweaked 1.88.0

* Computers and turtles now preserve their ID when broken.
* Add `peripheral.getName` - returns the name of a wrapped peripheral.
* Reduce network overhead of monitors and terminals.
* Add a TBO backend for monitors, with a significant performance boost.
* The Lua REPL warns when declaring locals (lupus590, exerro)
* Add config to allow using command computers in survival.
* Add fs.isDriveRoot - checks if a path is the root of a drive.
* `cc.pretty` can now display a function's arguments and where it was defined. The Lua REPL will show arguments by default.
* Move the shell's `require`/`package` implementation to a separate `cc.require` module.
* Move treasure programs into a separate external data pack.

And several bug fixes:
* Fix io.lines not accepting arguments.
* Fix settings.load using an unknown global (MCJack123).
* Prevent computers scanning peripherals twice.
