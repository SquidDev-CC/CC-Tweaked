New features in CC: Tweaked 1.83.0

* Add Chinese translation (XuyuEre)
* Small performance optimisations for packet sending.
* Provide an `arg` table to programs fun from the shell, similar to PUC Lua.
* Add `os.date`, and handle passing datetime tables to `os.time`, making them largely compatible with PUC Lua.
* `rm` and `mkdir` accept multiple arguments (hydraz, JakobDev).
* Rework rendering of in-hand pocket computers.
* Prevent rendering of a bounding box on a monitor's screen.
* Refactor Lua-side type checking code into a single method. Also include the function name in error messages.

And several bug fixes:
* Fix incorrect computation of server-tick budget.
* Fix list-based config options not reloading.
* Ensure `require` is usable within the Lua REPL.
